### Start the server

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Make a copy of the file `.env.example` and rename it as `.env`.         
2. <del>In the `.env` file, enter your OpenAI account information and Telegram bot token. Set `IS_GOOGLE_LOGIN` to `true` if you're using Google auth.</del>           
3. Specify the ID of the users and groups who are permitted to use this bot. Separate multiple IDs with commas (`,`). Note that all members of the specified groups will have access to the bot inside the group. **If you leave these options empty, every person and group will be able to use the bot.**           
4. <del>If the browser is not installed in the default location, specify its executable path. You can also specify proxy settings, if needed.</del>           
5. <del>Specify the `NOPECHA_KEY` or `CAPTCHA_TOKEN` if you're using the corresponding CAPTCHA solver.</del>           
6. You can also specify the command to invoke the bot in group chats. The default command is `/chat`.           
7. <del>Set `IS_PRO_ACCOUNT` to `true` if you're using a premium / pro / paid account. </del>              
8. Specify the `OPENAI_API_KEY` of your openai platform account.

```
